\subsection{Software and Data Availability}

All statistical analyses were conducted with the R statistical programming language \citep{RSoftware2019}. The R package miQTL was used for all the mapping and mediations analyses, and is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/gkeele/miqtl}. A static version of miQTL is also provided in the \textbf{Supplement} (File S1).
